                        <strong>Length Over Complexity:</strong> Aim for passwords of 12 characters or more. Long passphrases (e.g., "CorrectHorseBatteryStaple") are easier to remember and harder to crack than complex short ones.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Use a Password Manager:</strong> Tools like lastpass or bitwarden generate complex, unique passwords for every site and store them securely. You only need to remember one master password.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA):</strong> This is non-negotiable. Even if your password is stolen, the attacker cannot log in without temporary code sent to your phone.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Never Reuse:</strong> A single data breach could compromise all your accounts if you use the same password everywhere. Ensure every service has a unique password.

                                <strong>Ransomware:</strong> Encrypt your files, demanding a fee for their release.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Check the Sender's Email Address:</strong> Attackers often use addresses that are close but not quite right (e.g., `micros0ft.com` instead of `microsoft.com`). Always look at the full sender details.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Beware of Urgency or Threat:</strong> Phishing emails often use high-pressure language ("Your account will be suspended in 2 hours!" or "Immediate action required!") to make you click before you think.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Hover Over Links:</strong> Before clicking any link, hover your mouse over it (or long-press on mobile) to see the true destination URL in the corner of your browser. If it doesn't match the company's domain, delete the email.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Verify Requests Separately:</strong> If you receive an email from your bank or a service asking you to log in or update details, do not use the link in the email. Instead, open a new browser tab and manually navigate to the company's official website.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Examine Attachments:</strong> Never open attachments that end in suspicious extensions like `.exe`, `.zip`, or `.js` unless you are absolutely sure of the source and were expecting the file.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Update Your Browser Immediately:</strong> Your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) is your main gateway to the internet. Always update it when prompted to ensure you have the latest security features.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Review Application Permissions:</strong> Regularly check which permissions your mobile apps and desktop software have. Uninstall apps you no longer use, as they are unmaintained potential security risks.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Do Not Ignore Notifications:</strong> When a device, app, or service prompts you to update, do it as soon as is practical. Delaying updates leaves you exposed to known threats.
